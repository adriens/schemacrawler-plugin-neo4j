# schemacrawler-plugin-neo4j [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/adriens/schemacrawler-plugin-neo4j.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/adriens/schemacrawler-plugin-neo4j)

## Description

This is a [schemacrawler](http://schemacrawler.sourceforge.net/ "Schemacrawler Homepage") [plugin](http://schemacrawler.sourceforge.net/plugins.html "Schemacrawler plugins homepage") that dumps database structure (also called schema) into a [neo4j](http://neo4j.com/ "Neo4j homepage") database. Once this done, you can view it in [neo4j web console](http://neo4j.com/developer/guide-data-visualization/#_product_keylines_neo4j_graph_visualization "Neo4j visualization"), perform [CYPHER](http://neo4j.com/developer/cypher-query-language/#_about_cypher "About CYPHER") queries on it and hence allows you to report your database schema the way you want.

You can see these features as an addon to native schemacrawler features.

## Why spending time developing this software ?

Because i find it fun to design a graph database schema to modelize a database schema ;-p

## Development status

For now this plugin is its very early stages as i use this project to :

* Develop schemacrawler plugins
* Discover neo4j technology and what i can do with it, at my job, but also just to jave fun with drawing nice graphs


# Create your graph

## Build the plugin

As this is a standard maven projet, just :

1. Clone this git repo
2. Jump in the project directory
3. `mvn clean package`
4. Get the `jar` in the `target` directory

Below command to build it yourself :

    git clone https://github.com/adriens/schemacrawler-plugin-neo4j.git
    cd schemacrawler-plugin-neo4j
    mvn package
    ls -la target/schemacrawler-plugin-neo4j-${version}.jar

## Schemacrawler requirements

To create your neo4j database for your database schema, you need :

* A proper schemacrawler install
* A database with a schema you want to analyze (and if possible a nice one). I personally did use the sportsdb database sample (http://www.sportsdb.org/sd/samples)
* Test a schemacrawler `graph` generation
* drop the jar you've built in `$SCHEMACARWLER_HOME/lib`

## Neo4j requirements

Follow neo4j [install instructions](http://neo4j.com/docs/stable/server-installation.html "Neo4j install instructions").
In the following sections, i will assume you are runnning neo4j on linux as it's
easier to document, but things are exactly the same.

Choose an **empty and dedicated* directoty that will contain the generated database : BEWARE AS DURING DATABASE CREATION THIS DIRECTORY WILL BE DELETED BY THE PLUGIN !**

# Generate the neo4j graph database

**Let's assume your neo4j graph database directory is `~/neo4j.`**

## Run the schemacrawler command

`schemacrawler -host=localhost -port=5432 -database=sportsdb -user=sports_adm -password=user_adm  -schemas=public -c=neo4j -infolevel=maximum -server=postgresql -loglevel=CONFIG -outputDir=./neo4j`

## Start neo4j server

`cd ~/apps/neo4j-community-2.3.0-M02 && ./bin/neo4j start`

## Browse the database

Go to neo4j webapp (http://localhost:7474) and take a look at your graph database schema


# (Dirty) dev scripts


##  Start neo4j server :

`cd ~/apps/neo4j-community-2.3.0-M02 && ./bin/neo4j start`

## Stop neo4j server and make some cleanup :

`cd ~/apps/neo4j-community-2.3.0-M02 && ./bin/neo4j stop && rm -rf ~/neo4j`

## Run schemacrawler

`cd ~/tmp
sudo cp ~/NetBeansProjects/schemacrawler-plugin-neo4j/target/schemacrawler-plugin-neo4j-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar /opt/schemacrawler/lib/ && schemacrawler -host=localhost -port=5432 -database=sportsdb -user=sports_adm -password=user_adm  -schemas=public -c=neo4j -infolevel=maximum -server=postgresql -loglevel=CONFIG -outputDir=./neo4j`

# Maven Central Repo availability

A ticket has been open to upload artifact to Sonatype (http://central.sonatype.org/), see
https://issues.sonatype.org/browse/OSSRH-16543 for more details.

# Donate

I'm not asking for money nor any kind of gift, but sometimes, to keep motivation
safe while developing free software, it's nice to get some recognization.
